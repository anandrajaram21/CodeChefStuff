## The Frontend Task

Need to replicate the design at [this link](https://bit.ly/CC-FigmaTemplate).

Just clone the repo on your computer, and open the index.html file if you want to test out locally.

### Setup Instructions

Run the following commands in your terminal

```
npm install
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

Now just open the index.html file in your browser.
